#requires: c1
parcoords shall visualize a h5 file parsed by c1. Every category that is found in the metadata
shall be one dimension of the parallel coords, if reasonable. 
The parallel coords shall be filterable, and shall provide additional visualisations for the 
filtered dataset, for example a list of contained keys.
